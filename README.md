Looks kinda like this idk might not update later...
Includes configs for pretty much everything I use on a daily basis, should be "clone and go" provided that you have all the packages on a fresh Arch install

I have no idea how commit messages work.

The post install script is entirely AI generated and untested on anything but a virtual machine as of now. Should work on my system (Lenovo LOQ 15IAX9) and has the packages that I want, I do NOT recommend anyone else using it.

Also don't touch the install script it's ass.
