I do NOT care about the install script anymore, just copy stuff over yourself.

This is what it looks like

Personal note: install intel-media-driver for smooth video playback in browsers. No idea why it isn't installed by defaut on modern intel devices but there's that.

For use on Arch Linux, Hyprland with most of the hypr utilities

Packages to get it going:
dunst fastfetch git firefox grim swappy thunar tumbler nwg-look hyprland hyprlock hyprpicker hyprpolkitagent hyprsunset xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland hyprshot imv kitty neovim npm zsh pavucontrol slurp ttf-font-awesome ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd ttf-apple-emoji wl-clipboard wlogout wofi wofi-emoji waybar cliphist

There's a lot of scripts in .config/hypr/scripts, you may or may not need to make them all executable yourself idk, still working on the install script which will hopefully do it for you

Why are there 4 packages for screenshots?

Why is this package list so hopelessly lost?
